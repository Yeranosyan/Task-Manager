## Fullstack Task Manager Application: Next.js, React, Prisma, MongoDB, React Icons, Clerk(Auth)

Hello everyone,

I am excited to announce that I have completed the FullStack Task Manager application. For the frontend, I leveraged React & Next.js 14 along with TypeScript. Additionally, I incorporated Tailwind CSS for styling, and for functional components, I wrote pure CSS. The icons used are provided by ReactIcons.
Clerk was chosen for authentication to secure the application. Two key pages, 'signin' and 'signup', were successfully implemented.

To enhance the user experience, I integrated react-hot-toast for beautiful notifications in the React app. Furthermore, I employed Next Js TopLoader to optimize the loading experience.

For data management, I utilized Prisma along with MongoDB. This combination ensures efficient and reliable data handling for the application.

Thank you for your support!
